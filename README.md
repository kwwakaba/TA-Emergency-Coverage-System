# TA-Emergency-Coverage-System

Abstract

When a TA is sick or cannot make lab, they system will notify the professor of the absence and the professor will then
select a TA that is available to cover. At the current moment, if a TA is unable to attend the lab for any reason, there
are a string of steps in which the TA can notify the professor and the professor to find a replacement. Additionally,
all the information the professor has (in terms of schedule and availability) is all kept locally and is done physically.
For an update to be done, the professor has to contact the TAs via email or talk in person to get more information,
which takes time. The solution we are looking for is a centralized location in which all the TAs contact information
and availability is located, and a way for the professor to be notified if a TA is unable to come to lab so the professor
may be able to find the next available person and contact them to cover for the lab. Professors and TAs need a usable
system, preferably intuitive, that can be updated on changing schedules of TAs.
